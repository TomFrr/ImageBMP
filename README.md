# Bitmap Image Manipulation Tools

## Overview
This project is a collection of bitmap image manipulation tools created for my second-year engineering studies. It provides basic operations on bitmap images through the Visual Studio console interface. The code is written in C# as part of my learning experience with this language.

## Learning Goals
This project helped me understand:
- Basics of bitmap image processing.
- Using the .NET framework and Visual Studio for C# development.
- Structuring a project in GitHub.

## Features
- **Bitmap Loading and Saving:** Open and save bitmap files in various formats.
- **Console Interface:** The program runs in the Visual Studio console and allows interaction through simple commands.
- **Image Manipulations:**
  
  - **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert images to grayscale.
  - **Black and White Conversion**: Apply a threshold to convert images to pure black and white.
  - **Mirror Effect**: Flip the image horizontally or vertically.
  - **Cropping**: Crop a specified area of the image.
  - **Scaling**: Enlarge or shrink the image size.
  - **Rotation**: Rotate the image by a specified angle.
  - **Convolution Filters**: Apply convolution operations for effects like blurring or edge detection.
  - **Fractal Generation**: Create fractal patterns within the image.
  - **Steganography**: Hide and retrieve hidden messages within the image data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Visual Studio** (recommended)
- **.NET SDK**: Ensure you have the correct version installed for C#.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomFrr/ImageBMP.git
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution to restore any dependencies.

### Usage
1. Run the application in Visual Studio.
2. Follow the on-screen console instructions to choose and apply image manipulations.
